## 3. Implementation Patterns

### React Gamification Components
```jsx
// Memoized Progress Bar
const ProgressBar = memo(({ xp, maxXP }) => {
  const percentage = (xp / maxXP) * 100;
  return (
    <div className="progress-container">
      <div className="progress-fill" style={{ width: `${percentage}%` }} />
      <span className="progress-text">{xp}/{maxXP} XP</span>
    </div>
  );
});
```

### Real-time Supabase Integration
```javascript
// Real-time leaderboard subscription
const subscribeToLeaderboard = (callback) => {
  return supabase
    .channel('leaderboard-changes')
    .on('postgres_changes', 
      { event: '*', schema: 'public', table: 'scores' }, 
      callback
    )
    .subscribe();
};
```

### Testing Strategy (TDD)
```javascript
// Jest + React Testing Library
test('should update score when player makes a move', () => {
  const { getByText } = render(<GameBoard />);
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('game-tile-1'));
  expect(screen.getByText(/Score: 10/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
});

// E2E with Cypress
it('should complete a full game session', () => {
  cy.visit('/games/memory-match');
  cy.get('[data-cy=start-game]').click();
  cy.get('[data-cy=game-tile]').first().click();
  cy.get('[data-cy=score]').should('not.contain', '0');
});
```

### DevOps Configuration
```yaml
# Kubernetes HPA for auto-scaling
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: game-service-hpa
spec:
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        averageUtilization: 70
```

## 4. Key Recommendations

### Development Priorities
1. **Phase 1**: Core React/TypeScript platform with Node.js backend
2. **Phase 2**: Supabase real-time features + Redis caching
3. **Phase 3**: TensorFlow.js browser-based AI detection
4. **Phase 4**: Unity WebGL integration + federated learning
5. **Phase 5**: Full AWS production scaling

### Success Factors from Research
